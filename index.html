<h1>What Command</h1>
This project supplies the old trusty "what" command that was used by
the sccs command.&nbsp; Sccs is a revision control system that
pre-dates rcs, cvs, subversion, etc.<br>
<br>
"What" is used to extract meta data about a file (revision, program
name, etc.) similarly to how the ident command works for rcs/cvs,
except there is only one "token" that identifies data to be output:
from "@(#)" until some non-printable character or &lt;.<br>
<br>
I have used my implementation for many years now but I wanted to give
it to the developer community, especially since I don't see a what
command on the Linux distributions I tend to use.<br>
